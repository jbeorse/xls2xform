xls2xform is a scrip to convert properly formatted excel into xforms
for ODK. Running the following command:

> python xls2xform.py surveys.py

creates an xform for each worksheet. This is a powerful way to create
xforms, I'm using it to work around using loops in ODK.

updateforms.sh is a shell script I use to load my newly created forms
onto my emulator.
