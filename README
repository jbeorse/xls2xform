xls2xform is a script to convert properly formatted excel files into
xforms for ODK. Running the following command:

> python xls2xform.py Harvest.xls

creates an xform for each worksheet in Harvest.xls (excluding the
sheet named "Choices", which describes multiple choice options). This
is a powerful way to create xforms, need to compare to alternatives.

updateforms.sh is a shell script I use to load my newly created forms
onto my emulator.




For recording the emulator use xwininfo to get the window id of the
emulator, then run the command

> recordmydesktop --windowid 0x4200003 --no-sound
